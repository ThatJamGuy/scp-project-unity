If you wish to contribute to SCP: Project Unity through commits or pull requests, theres just a couple of things to note.

1. Do not submit malicious commits/pull requests
2. Do not submit broken commits/pull requests
3. Do not submit pointless commits/pull requests

Really it'd just be appreciated if the project doesn't get messed up, so be careful what you submit to the repo!
If you end up contributing, you'll earn a spot in the GitHub credits before the final release in which there will be in game credits.
