# SCP: Project Unity
Just my attempt at remaking SCP:CB in the Unity Engine. Built on Unity 2022.3.14f1 HDRP.
Inspired by the cancelled SCP: Unity and Faithful-SCP-Unity repository which recently recieved a new developer earlier this year.

# Want to contribute?
Every action I take in the development process could alwways be better, especially with how the code is written and managed, so if you think you can do something better, feel free to make a pull request!
