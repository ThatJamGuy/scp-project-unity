# SCP: Project Unity
Just my attempt at remaking SCP:CB in the Unity Engine. Built on Unity 2022.3.15f1 HDRP.
Inspired by the cancelled SCP: Unity and Faithful-SCP-Unity repository which recently recieved a new developer earlier this year.

# Features
- Completelly random map generation, instead of being pattern based. Using GasimoCodes MapGen system for this
- (Hopefully) Better written code for easier modifications
- Eventually, better and more realistic AI systems
- Eventually, maybe even support for mods, but we'll see where the project goes.
- Eventually, revamped cutscenes to make it hopefully better (For example, the SCP-096 server room event could use some work to be more impactful)

# Project Direction
A lot of SCP:CB Remakes (Or projects that use SCP:CBs assets) exist, but while some are pretty close to the OG [ie. SCP Lab Rat] there are others that start off as a faithful recreation until eventually becoming it's own thing [it. SCP:Unity]. So where is this project headed? I figured I would have something of a midpoint betwewen the two directions. I'll stay pretty close to the OG, while making modifications here and there that make it feel like a more modern game. This can range anywhere from "Maybe adding a few props in this room will do that trick." to "This room needs to be completelly redone." or "A new never seen before room would be good here." The project is still in it's early stage so there is still much to decide, but this was the idea.

# Want to contribute?
Now, as one developer that still has a lot to learn, my solutions to stuff likely have better ways to go about them. So, I've made this a public open-source repository for anyone to open and modify to possibly make it better. If anyone does so and makes a good change/addition, I'll merge it with the official repository and proper credit will be given.

# Please Note
Although this project is gaining more features and bug-fixes, it still is not in a very playable state. You can download and open the project in unity, but don't expect very much from it. Even the main menu (At the time of writing) has to be redone from the changes made during one of the more recent commits.
